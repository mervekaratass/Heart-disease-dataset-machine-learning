# Heart-disease-dataset-machine-learning
The heart disease dataset is a ready-made dataset from the Kaggle dataset repository. This dataset consists of both sick and healthy cases. In the heart disease dataset, certain classifications are made by considering the health information of the person.It was divided into two groups as patient and normal. Analysis of the heart disease dataset was performed on the RapidMiner Studio platform. Heart disease dataset analysis was performed on RapidMiner Studio platform. Data cleaning was not performed because the received data did not contain incomplete and noisy data. In order to achieve better performance in the data set, transformation and normalization were performed from the data preprocessing steps. Then, machine learning models were used in the data set. These; artificial neural networks, k-nn and decision tree. These three methods were applied on the data set and their performances were determined and compared. By comparing the performances of the three models used, the best prediction model in the data set was found.
